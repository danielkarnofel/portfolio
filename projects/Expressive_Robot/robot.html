        <p> After suffering a terrible existential crisis, this robot fled into the wasteland in search for purpose and love. </p>
        <p> With your god-like power, you have the choice to strike him with lightning or give him the roses he needs to achieve happiness. </p>
        <p> His batteries are limited, but the impact you can have on his short life is surely immeasurable. </p>
